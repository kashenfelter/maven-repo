h1. stackmagic's travic-ci dashboard

p. you may have come here by way of my "travis-ci dashboard":http://stackmagic.github.com/maven-repo/travis-ci-dashboard.html

p. you can use this dashboard for yourself as it is right now, just append "#myusername" to the url and you have your very own dashboard instantly!! so the url for twitter's projects on travis-ci would be "http://stackmagic.github.com/maven-repo/travis-ci-dashboard.html#twitter":http://stackmagic.github.com/maven-repo/travis-ci-dashboard.html#twitter

p. enjoy!
